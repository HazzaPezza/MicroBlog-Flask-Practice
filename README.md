# MicroBlog-Flask-Practice
Using a tutorial to understand the basics of Flask. Will customise blog to look more like something I've made. 

Tutorial can be found here:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

I am practicing with flask for 3 reasons:
  1. Python is my favourite language.
  2. I have failed two interviews due to Flask based questions.
  3. I want to learn a new framework for fun.

I found this project and tutorial from the 'project-based-learning' repository.

Feel free to use any of the code for whatever I really can't claim much of it anyway.
